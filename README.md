# Recipe Book

```

> git clone https://github.com/testcodingskill/receipe-app.git
> cd recipe-app
> npm install
> ng serve

```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).



# Technical Automation Test
As a short listed candidate for our current Automation Testing role, we would appreciate it if you could complete this Technical Automation Test. The test should only take you approximately 3 hrs to complete and will help us to assess which candidates to then invite in for our face to face cultural interview process.

Automation Test Tasks
·       Clone the code from the above repo
·       Assess what needs to be tested
·       Assess the coverage provided by the given unit tests within the application
·       Come up with a test plan for what could possibly be automated that covers the following test levels:
o   Unit test level
o   Integration level
o   UI automation level
·       Automate (up and running) at least one level of testing
·       Zip your results and share the code, with instructions on how to build and run it, along with the test plan(s) covering the above details
